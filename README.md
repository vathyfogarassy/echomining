# Text mining method to extract measurement results from echocardiography documents
## A novel language-independent method

The Python implementation codes of a novel text mining-based information retrieval method will be available in this folder. The method was developed to extract numerical measurement results from echocardiography documents.  

The method applies generally applicable text cleaning preprocessing activities and does not rely on any information regarding the structure of the documents and the data recording habits. The method automatically identifies the texts fragments of measurement descriptions, and then by matching them to the elements of standardized terminology, are unified. The methodology allows identifying, correcting and unifying the synonyms, acronyms, and typos. Since the methodology used does not contain any language-dependent implementation elements, the proposed method is suitable for processing echocardiographic findings written in any language.
The method was evaluated on a document set containing more than 20,000 echocardiography reports. During the evaluation 12 relevant echocardiography parameters were extracted from the documents. As a result, an average sensitivity of 0.904, an average specificity of 1.0 and an average F1-score of 0.948 were obtained. The case study sufficiently demonstrated the broad applicability of the method also confirmed by the experts. 

The description of the method was submitted for publication to the journal Artificial Intelligence in Medicine on 3 January 2022.

Codes are coming soon...
